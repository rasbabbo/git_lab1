THE GIT CHEATSHEET!

my memory is awful!

1) --version - checks whether installed
1A) init - initalizes repo (ONLY DO IN APPROPRIATE PARENT FILE!!!!!!)
2) add + name of file - adds file to repo
3) add .  = adds whole directory to repo
4) commit -m "add comment" = commits to repo

OBSERVATIONS
1) status (file) = checks the ..
2) diff = what has changed
3) log  = shows version history
4) help on command
gonna throw this new line in just for the hell of it
and then, just to see, blah, 
gonna change erased some things
this will be the changes made in github
